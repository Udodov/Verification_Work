# Verification_Work
Hello everyone!
In this project, I needed to complete the solution of the problem:

*Task condition:*
Write a program that, from an existing array of strings, forms an array of strings whose length is less than or equal to 3 characters.

The initial array can be entered from the keyboard, or set at the start of the algorithm execution. When solving, it is not recommended to use collections, it is better to do exclusively with arrays.

*Examples*:

["hello", "2", "world", ":-)"] -> ["2", ":-)"]

["1234", "1567", "-2", "computer science"] -> ["-2"]

["Russia", "Denmark", "Kazan"] -> []

---

But in order to fully perform the verification work , it was necessary:

1. Create a repository on GitHub
2. Draw a flowchart of the algorithm (you can do with a flowchart of the main content part if you separate it into a separate method)
3. Provide the repository with a decorated text description of the solution (file readme.md) 
4. Write a program that solves the task
5. Use version control in working on this small project (it should not be so that everything is flooded with one commit, at least stages 2, 3 and 4 should be located in different commits)

---

Therefore, my solution is presented in this repository and with a description in the file readme.md

Thanks to everyone who showed interest in this work! :)

With respect,

Konstantin Udodov (GeekBrains student of the Developer program)
